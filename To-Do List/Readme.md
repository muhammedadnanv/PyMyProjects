# Python Terminal-Based To-Do List App

This is a simple terminal-based To-Do List app built using Python. It allows you to manage your tasks directly from the terminal. You can add, remove, and view tasks, and the tasks will persist between sessions by saving to a file.

## Features

- Add tasks to your to-do list
- View all tasks in your list
- Remove tasks from your list
- Tasks are saved to a `tasks.txt` file and loaded on app startup

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

You can check if Python is installed by running:

```bash
python --version
