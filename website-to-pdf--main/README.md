# Website-to-PDF Module

The `website-to-pdf` module is a simple Node.js script that converts a website into a PDF file using Puppeteer, a headless browser library. This module allows you to capture and save any web page as a PDF with just a few lines of code.

## Features

- Convert any website URL to a PDF file.
- Customize PDF options such as format, margins, and background.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   Clone the repository using Git or download the source code as a ZIP file.

   ```bash
   
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the Module**

   Create a file named `index.js` (or use an existing one) to use the module. Here's a basic example:

   ```javascript
   const convertToPDF = require('./convertToPDF');

   // URL of the website you want to convert to PDF
   const url = 'https://example.com';
   // Output file path
   const outputFilePath = 'website.pdf';

   convertToPDF(url, outputFilePath);
   ```

2. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   This command will convert the specified website URL into a PDF and save it as `website.pdf` in your project directory.

## API

### `convertToPDF(url, outputFilePath)`

- **`url`**: The URL of the website you want to convert to PDF. (e.g., `https://example.com`)
- **`outputFilePath`**: The path where the generated PDF file will be saved. (e.g., `website.pdf`)

### Options

You can customize the PDF generation by modifying the options in the `convertToPDF.js` file:

```javascript
await page.pdf({
    path: outputFilePath,
    format: 'A4',  // PDF format size
    printBackground: true,  // Print background graphics
    margin: {
        top: '20px',
        right: '20px',
        bottom: '20px',
        left: '20px'
    }
});
```
